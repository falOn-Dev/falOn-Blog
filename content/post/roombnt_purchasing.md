It is time to start a new project. I've been interested in learning ROS but had no real desire to build a full robot from scratch. I put it on the back burner to work on my keyboard project, but now that I'm done with that, it's time. Coincidentally, a friend of mine from my robotics team recently told me that a nearby thrift shop was selling robot vacuums (like Roombas). I decided that modding one of those would be a lovely project for ROS, so I went to purchase some.

As you can see, I was lucky enough to find two of them! A Roomba 891, and a Eufy Robovac 25c. As of the time of writing this, I'm charging both of them to begin testing what I can do with them! Stay tuned to see where I go from here, I have a lot of interesting ideas to test out on both of them.
